Code,Indicator Name,Long definition,Topic,Unit of measure
4.1.2_REN.ELECTRICITY.OUTPUT,Renewable electricity output (GWh),"Renewable electricity output (GWh): Electric output (GWh) of power plants using renewable resources, including wind, solar PV, solar thermal, hydro, marine, geothermal, solid biofuels, renewable municipal waste, liquid biofuels and biogas. Electricity production from hydro pumped storage is excluded.",Renewable Energy,GWh
4.1_SHARE.RE.IN.ELECTRICITY,Renewable electricity share of total electricity output (%),Renewable electricity share of total electricity output (%): Electricity generated by power plants using renewable resources as a share of total electricity output.,Renewable Energy,%
3.1_RE.CONSUMPTION,Renewable energy consumption (TJ),"Renewable energy consumption (TJ): This indicator includes energy consumption from all renewable resources: hydro, solid biofuels, wind, solar, liquid biofuels, biogas, geothermal, marine and waste",Renewable Energy,TJ
1.1_TOTAL.FINAL.ENERGY.CONSUM,Total final energy consumption (TFEC) (TJ),Total final energy consumption (TFEC): This indicator is derived form energy balances statistics and is equivalent to total final consumption excluding non-energy use,Renewable Energy,TJ
4.1.1_TOTAL.ELECTRICITY.OUTPUT,Total electricity output (GWh),Total electricity output (GWh): Total number of GWh generated by all power plants,Renewable Energy,GWh
2.1_SHARE.TOTAL.RE.IN.TFEC,Renewable energy share of TFEC (%),Renewable energy share of TFEC (%): Share of renewable energy in total final energy consumption,Renewable Energy,%
6.1_PRIMARY.ENERGY.INTENSITY,Energy intensity level of primary energy (MJ/2011 USD PPP),Energy intensity level of primary energy (MJ/2011 USD PPP): A ratio between energy supply and gross domestic product measured at purchasing power parity. Energy intensity is an indication of how much energy is used to produce one unit of economic output. A lower ratio indicates that less energy is used to produce one unit of output.,Energy efficiency,MJ/2011 USD PPP
1.3_ACCESS.ELECTRICITY.URBAN,Access to electricity (% of urban population with access),Access to electricity (% of urban population with access): Percentage of urban population with access to electricity,Access to energy,"Data for access to electricity are collected among different sources: mostly data from nationally representative household surveys (including national censuses) were used. Survey sources include Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and Living Standards Measurement Surveys (LSMS), Multi-Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), the World Health Survey (WHS), other nationally developed and implemented surveys, and various government agencies (for example, ministries of energy and utilities). Given the low frequency and the regional distribution of some surveys, a number of countries have gaps in available data. To develop the historical evolution and starting point of electrification rates, a simple modeling approach was adopted to fill in the missing data points - around 1990, around 2000, and around 2010. Therefore, a country can have a continuum of zero to three data points.  The model keeps the original observation if data is available for any of the time periods. This modeling approach allowed the estimation of electrification rates for 212 countries over these three time periods (Indicated as "Estimate"). Notation "Assumption" refers to the assumption of universal access in countries classified as developed by the United Nations."
